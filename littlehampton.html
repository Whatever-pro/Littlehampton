<div class="main">
    <p>
        Littlehampton is a town, seaside resort and pleasure harbour, and the most populous civil parish in the Arun District of West Sussex, England.
        It lies on the English Channel on the eastern bank of the mouth of the River Arun. It is 51.5 miles (83 km) south south-west of London,
        19 miles (31 km) west of Brighton and 10 miles (16 km) east of the county town of Chichester.
    </p>
    <p>
        The parish covers an area of 11.35 km2 (4 sq mi). The suburban area of the town has a population of approximately 55,000. The conurbation includes other settlements:
        Wick in the north west; Lyminster to the north; and Rustington to the east. Wick and Toddington, which has a large business park,
        became part of the town in 1901. Nearby towns include Bognor Regis and Worthing to the east.
    </p>
    <p>
        The town is also the westernmost settlement of the 15th largest urban area in England and Wales, the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation,
        a region encompassing 474,485 people (2011 census). The South Downs National Park commences 3 miles (4.8 km) north of the town:
        Littlehampton links to Amberley and Arundel by footpaths and railway as well as by roads.

    <h1 class="history">History</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A human settlement at Littlehampton can be traced back to prehistoric and Roman times, while it appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as the
        small hamlet of 'Hantone'.[4] The settlement is believed to have been a fishing community around this time, appearing on a French map in
        around 1100 as 'Hanton'.[4] The settlement is then believed to have been given to the Abbey of St Martin de Seez in Normandy, who owned
        Littlehampton until around 1400. The area then passed back to
        the ownership of successive Earls of Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk, whose successors still reside in Arundel today.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Littlehampton began to develop as a port as a result of constant silting of the River Arun, perhaps leading to the prefix of 'Little' being added to 'Hampton',
        in order to distinguish it from the larger Southampton further along the coast. The expansion of port
        activities led to a new river mouth being cut in 1735, alongside the building of a wooden harbour. At this time it was also known as Arundel Port.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the eighteenth century progressed, the town developed from a fishing community to a holiday destination, with Lord Byron, Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
        Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Constable all believed to have spent time there.
    </p>
    <p>The town's status as both a port and a holiday resort led to economic success in the nineteenth century, with a railway line and a cross-channel
         ferry to Honfleur in France being introduced.[6] The population of the town grew tenfold over the century, from 584 in 1801 to 5,954 in 1901.
         Littlehampton remained as a holiday resort in the twentieth century, becoming known as 'The Children's Paradise' in the 1920s.
    </p>
    <p>
        Post-war Littlehampton saw large-scale house building on the outskirts of the town, eventually absorbing the surrounding villages of Wick, Lyminster and
        Toddington, while the commercial element of the town became increasingly focused on boat building and water sports.
